One project idea could be an app that (I know this exists but still is interesting to me) has a graphic that you track the amount of water you drink in a day and it help motivate you by sending you notifications, but also gaining acheivments by drinking enough wather through the day. Another idea could be a Calvin-only dating app... I know that sounds dumb, but I am not a very good idea guy.
